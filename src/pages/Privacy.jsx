              iii. The legal grounds for our processing your Personal
              Information for the purposes in this Policy are as follows:
              <div className="ml-5 mt-5">
                1. you provided your consent by agreeing to this Policy, which
                you may withdraw at any time by emailing us at the email address
                provided in Section X;

              <div className="ml-5 mt-5">
                3. the processing is necessary for us to comply with our legal
                or regulatory obligations;
              </div>
              <div className="ml-5 mt-5">
                4. the processing is in our legitimate interest as a provider of
                the Application (for example, to protect the security and
                integrity of our systems and to provide you with customer

            b. Other International Transfers
            <div className="mt-5 ml-5">
              i. If you are located outside the U.S., the EU, the UK, and
              Switzerland, and you choose to provide Personal Information to us,
              we may transfer your Personal Information to the U.S. and process
              it there (or any other country where we operate or may have
              co-locations). When you provide Personal Information, it may be
              sent to servers located in the U.S. and other countries around the
              world. If you reside or are located within the EU, the UK, or
              Switzerland and such transfers occur, we take appropriate steps to
              provide the same level of protection for the processing carried
              out in any such countries as you would have within the EU, the UK,
              or Switzerland to the extent reasonably feasible under applicable
              law.

        VII. California Privacy Rights
        <div className="ml-5 mt-5">
          a. California law permits California residents to request and obtain
          from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to
          whom we have disclosed their Personal Information (if any) for their
          direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the
          type of Personal Information disclosed to those third parties. See
          Section X for where to direct such requests. We do not share your
          Personal Information with third parties for their own direct marketing
          purposes without your prior consent. Accordingly, you can prevent
          disclosure of your Personal Information to third parties for their
          direct marketing purposes by withholding consent.
        </div>
        <div className="ml-5 mt-5">
          b. Effective January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act of
          2018 (the “CCPA”) allows California residents, upon a verifiable
          consumer request, to request that a business that collects consumers’
          personal information (as defined in the CCPA) to give consumers
          access, in a portable and (if technically feasible) readily usable
          form, to the specific pieces and categories of Personal Information
          that the business has collected about the consumer, the categories of
          sources for that information, the business or commercial purposes for
          collecting the information, and the categories of third parties with
          which the information was shared. California residents also have the
          right to submit a request for deletion of information under certain
          circumstances. See Section X for where to direct such requests.
          Consistent with California law, if you choose to exercise your rights,
          we will not charge you different prices or provide different quality
          of services unless those differences are related to your information.
          Please note that you must verify your identity and request before
          further action is taken. As a part of this process, government
          identification may be required. Consistent with California law, you
          may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To
          designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, you
          must provide a valid power of attorney, the requester’s valid
          government issued identification, and the authorized agent’s valid
          government issued identification.
