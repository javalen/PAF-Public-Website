      question: "How does PAF differ from other property management software?",
      answer:
        "Most property management software focuses on business financials, tenant relationships, and work orders. PredictiveAF (PAF), however, is purpose-built for mechanical systems. It automates the maintenance of these systems, enabling property management companies to enhance property upkeep and instantly access maintenance information.",
